DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
differ on details -- some request registration while others
require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
using the software to an updated program with printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
specific group. For example, some authors require written
permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
Shareware (see enclosed VENDOR.DOC).

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.

DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

Users of MATCH SOFTWARE FONTS must accept this disclaimer of
warranty:"BUJARDET FRERES FONT is supplied as is. The author
disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, including, without
limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any
purpose. The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or
consequential, which may result from the use of BUJARDET FRERES FONT"

These fonts are "shareware program" and are provided at no charge to
the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends,
but please do not give it away altered or as part of another system.
The essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal
computer users with quality software without high prices, and yet to
provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
products. If you find this program useful and find that you are
using this font and continue to use this font after a reasonable
trial period, you must make a registration payment of $10 (in US
funds) to Match Software. See order form at the end of this document.

This registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like a
book.  An example is that this software may be used by any number of
people and may be freely moved from one computer location to
another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one
location while it's being used at another. Just as a book cannot be
read by two different persons at the same time.
